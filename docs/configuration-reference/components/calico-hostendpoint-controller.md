## Introduction

A host endpoint resource (HostEndpoint) in Calico represents one or more real or virtual interfaces
attached to a host that is running Calico. It enforces Calico policy on the traffic that is entering
or leaving the hostâ€™s default network namespace through those interfaces.

This component makes sure new nodes get Calico HostEndpoint objects when they're created and those
objects get removed when nodes they refer to are deleted.

This is relevant for Lokomotive clusters in bare-metal or Packet because there are no external
security primitives and nodes must rely on HostEndpoint objects to be secured.


## Prerequisites

* A Lokomotive cluster accessible via `kubectl` deployed on Packet.

* Calico as the CNI plugin.

## Configuration

This component does not require any specific configuration.
